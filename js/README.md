The JavaScript code in this folder was downloaded from the AIRA website.

It appears to contain code to interface with the TR-8S from a JavaScript environment.
Some of the code is related to front-end rendering and error-handling.

This code can't be run as-is but should be able to be analyzed and put back together down the road.

As the website provides features such as sample and pattern transfer, backups, and firmware installation,
   the hope is that this code can be converted into a standalone application for managing
   samples and patterns on the TR-8S.
