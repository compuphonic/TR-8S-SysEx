The JavaScript code in this folder was downloaded from the AIRA website.

It appears to contain code to interface with the TR-8S from a JavaScript environment.
Some of the code is related to front-end rendering and error-handling.

As the website provides features such as sample and pattern transfer, backups, and firmware installation,
   the hope is that this code can be converted into a standalone application for managing
   samples and patterns on the TR-8S.
